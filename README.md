# Door Jam

This is a project for Physical Computing Studio (48-390) at CMU in Spring 2015. We built a device that shines a laser "tripwire" across the bottom of a doorway and pushes to a web interface/tweets every time the tripwire is broken. This repo contains the code for the web interface, we used an arduino, wixels with serial communication, and node.js for this project.
